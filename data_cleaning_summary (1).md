# Data_Cleaning_Summary.md

## ðŸ“Œ Data Cleaning Steps
- All cleaning and transformation steps were done inside Power BI using Power Query Editor.
- Columns were renamed, unnecessary fields removed, and data types corrected.
- Derived columns created: Profit %, Loss Value, Net Profit.
- Relationships built between Fact and Dimension tables for accurate filtering.
- Date hierarchy created from Order Date.

No separate cleaned CSV file is included as the cleaning logic is fully embedded in the `.pbix` file.
